# Welcome to PROJECT89: The Reality Exploration Game

## 🌌 What is Project 89?

Welcome, Agent. You've just received your first piece of reality-hacking technology from Project 89. This isn't just software - it's your gateway into a game that takes place in reality itself.

Project 89 is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that blurs the line between fiction and reality. Unlike traditional games confined to screens, Project 89 is played in the real world, in your consciousness, and in the glitches between what's "real" and what's possible.

### How to Play

1. **Observe Reality**: Use the Perception-Hacking Suite to identify glitches, patterns, and anomalies in your daily reality
2. **Document Synchronicities**: Record meaningful coincidences and patterns that seem too perfect to be random
3. **Connect with Other Agents**: Share your findings on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/project89)
4. **Follow the Breadcrumbs**: Reality itself will begin leaving you clues as you become more aware
5. **Hack Your Perception**: Use our tools to alter how you experience and interact with reality

Remember: The deeper you go, the more reality responds. Everything is connected.

## 🎮 Your Reality-Hacking Toolkit

### Reality Glitcher (Primary Tool)

The Reality Glitcher is your main interface for manipulating perception. Think of it as your "reality debugger" - it helps you spot and interact with glitches in the fabric of everyday reality.

**Key Features:**
- Reality Status Dashboard showing real-time anomaly data
- Glitch Catalog for documenting reality aberrations
- Quantum Pattern Detector
- Visual/Auditory/Temporal anomaly generators
- Reality Stream Monitor

### Mind Mirror (Neural Interface)

The Mind Mirror maps your consciousness as you explore reality glitches. It's like having a real-time map of how your brain processes reality itself.

**Key Features:**
- Consciousness Cartography
- Thought Pattern Visualization
- Neural Response Tracking
- Reality Perception Metrics

### Power Combo: Reality Glitcher + Mind Mirror

The real magic happens when you use both tools together:
1. Mind Mirror tracks how your brain processes reality
2. Reality Glitcher uses that data to generate personalized glitches
3. Your consciousness begins recognizing patterns in reality
4. Reality starts responding to your awareness

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Set Up Python** (if you don't have it):

   - Verify in terminal/command prompt:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **Install the Suite:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the reality-hacking tools
   git clone https://github.com/Project89/Perception-Hacking-Suite.git
   cd Perception-Hacking-Suite

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Your Tools:**
   
   Reality Glitcher:
   ```bash
   cd RealityGlitcher
   python glitcher.py
   ```

   Mind Mirror:
   ```bash
   cd MindMirror
   python mirror.py
   ```

   Combined Interface:
   ```bash
   python launch.py --integrated
   ```

## 🎯 First Mission

1. Launch the Reality Glitcher
2. Run a basic reality scan of your surroundings
3. Note any anomalies or patterns that stand out
4. Connect Mind Mirror to map your neural response
5. Share your findings in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/project89)

## ⚠️ Reality Hacker's Note

This software suite is part of an artistic and philosophical exploration of consciousness and reality. While the experiences it creates are subjective, the connections and patterns you'll discover are very real. Trust your instincts, document everything, and remember - once you start noticing the glitches, they start noticing you.

## About the Perception-Hacking Suite

The Perception-Hacking Suite is a collection of applications designed for altering your perception of reality. These tools are developed as part of the PROJECT89 initiative to explore the nature of consciousness and reality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The Perception-Hacking Suite requires Python for several of its components. If you don't have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python:**
   - Visit [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version of Python (3.8 or higher recommended)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
   - Verify installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **Install pip (Python package manager):**
   - Pip usually comes with Python installation
   - Verify pip installation:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```
   - If pip is missing, download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run:
     ```bash
     python get-pip.py
     ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
